## Implementation Details

### Data Structure

The component uses Firebase Realtime Database with the following structure:

```
simplechat_groups/
  group_id/
    id: string
    name: string
    createdBy: string
    createdAt: number

simplechat_messages/
  group_id/
    message_id/
      id: string
      userId: string
      userName: string
      text: string
      timestamp: number
```

### Core Functionality

1. **User Authentication**: Users enter their name to join the chat system
2. **Group Management**: Users can create new groups or join existing ones
3. **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received in real-time using Firebase listeners
4. **Message History**: All messages are stored and displayed chronologically
5. **UI State Management**: Active group tracking, message input handling, and UI updates

### Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design with:
- Clean color scheme using indigo as the primary color
- Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Card-based design with shadows and rounded corners
- Clear visual distinction between sent and received messages

## Usage

1. Enter your name to join the chat
2. Create a new group or select an existing one
3. Start sending messages to your group
4. Logout when finished

## Component Structure

```tsx
<SimpleGroupChatV2 />
```

The component manages all its own state and Firebase connections internally.
