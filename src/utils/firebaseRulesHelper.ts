/**
 * Firebase Rules Helper
 * 
 * This utility provides guidance for setting up Firebase Realtime Database rules
 * for the EduVerse chat application.
 * 
 * Current Issue: Your Firebase rules have a time-based restriction that expires on 2025-11-03.
 * After this date, no one will be able to read or write to the database.
 * 
 * To use these rules:
 * 1. Go to the Firebase Console
 * 2. Select your project
 * 3. Navigate to Realtime Database
 * 4. Click on "Rules" tab
 * 5. Replace the existing rules with one of the configurations below
 * 6. Click "Publish"

// Option 1: Secure rules (requires authentication)
export const secureRules = {
  "rules": {
    "messages": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null",
      ".indexOn": ["timestamp"]
    }
  }
};

// Option 2: Public rules (allows read/write without authentication)
// WARNING: This makes your database publicly accessible
export const publicRules = {
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
    "messages": {
      ".indexOn": ["timestamp"]
    }
  }
};

// Option 3: Mixed approach (read requires auth, write is public)
// This allows anyone to send messages but only authenticated users can read
export const mixedRules = {
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": true,
    "messages": {
      ".indexOn": ["timestamp"]
    }
  }
};

/**
 * Instructions for setting Firebase rules:
 * 
 * 1. For development/testing (public access):
 *    Use the publicRules configuration above
 * 
 * 2. For production (secure access):
 *    Use the secureRules configuration above
 *    Ensure anonymous authentication is enabled in Firebase Console:
 *    - Go to Firebase Console
 *    - Select your project
 *    - Navigate to Authentication
 *    - Click on "Sign-in method" tab
 *    - Enable "Anonymous" sign-in provider
 * 
 * 3. To enable anonymous authentication via Firebase CLI:
 *    firebase auth:update --anonymous-enabled=true
 * 
 * Note: The "admin-restricted-operation" error typically occurs when:
 * - Anonymous authentication is not enabled in Firebase Console
 * - The Firebase project has restrictions on client-side operations
 * - The API key being used has restrictions
 * - Time-based rules have expired (like your current issue)
